Bob cannot compromise the system. If he tries to edit any files (by redirecting), those files are first opened by his shell which does not have root permissions. /bin/cat does not open any files for writing, and hence the elevated privileges with which /bin/cat runs cannot be used to modify files if Bob does not have write permissions to those files in the first place.
This is why the ./script | sudo tee FILE paradigm is used to redirect the output of a script to a file that is writable by root only. tee opens FILE in this case and can hence open files for writing with elevated privileges granted by sudo.
