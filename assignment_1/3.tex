\section{Question 3}

What will be the output for the program with following operation?
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a new file “f1” and write “abcde” in it and close
  \item Open the file “f1” for writing with O\_APPEND flag
  \item lseek to the beginning of the file
  \item Replace the existing data in the file with “12345”
\end{enumerate}
Justify your answer.

\subsection{Explanation}
\texttt{O\_APPEND} flag forces file pointer to point at the end of file whenever
any operation is performed.  So if you do lseek from start of the file, it takes
the updated file pointer position as a start of file i.e. end position of old
file.
